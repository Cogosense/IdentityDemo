SSL Certs for DEV
=================

Create development keys for a server running on host

./create_dev_keys <hostname>

hostname must be resolvable by the client device DNS, if it isn't use the IP address
of the DEV machine instead.

Production certs
================

Decrypt the production key with the following command:

    openssl rsa -in encrypted.key -out bcsa.key

You will need the encryption password.
