Hi <%= firstName %>,

Your BCSA account is now active.

Your email address <%= email %> is required in the event that
you forget your password. A password reset link will be sent
to this address. If you change email addresses, make sure you
update the email address associated with your BCSA account.

In the event you lose access to your email account and you
forget your password, you will not be able to gain access to
your existing BCSA account and will have to create a new one.

Our support team is ready to help answer any questions you may
have and can be reached by email at:

Thanks for using the BCSA service
